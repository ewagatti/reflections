How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By comparing the 2 versions of my file I could quickly find where I did a mistake. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    To have access to the entire history I can analyze all changes and figure out my mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Manually saving helps commit versions as necessary.
    On the other hand, with automatically saved changes, we don't run the risk of losing our changes once we forgot to save them.  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows us to save multiple files in one commit, so that when we work on multifile projects we want to track them toghether. When I save my version in my Git I will save a version in every file in the repository.  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    By using git log we may see all commits that have been done whereas, git diff shows us differences between one commit and another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    I might make my changes and feel confident as there is alway version control system which helps me to find out bugs going through each commit that have been done.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use Git for fixing bugs, new features, update docs, experimental features.
