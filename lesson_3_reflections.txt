When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you push your work from different computers, or when more people are working on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
I can control which commits I want to share with others in my public Git repository.
