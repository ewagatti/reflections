When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you push your work from different computers, or when more people are working on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
I can control which commits I want to share with others in my public Git repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
Forks - possible only on Github, you clone one repository from someone's GitHub,
you can fork it into your own GitHub.
Clones refers to clone between Github and a repo locally. It is possible to clone a
repo from Github to local computer to make changes.
Branches - labeled commits of one respository. When you work on new features on current project, 
you can create a new branch without changing your master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit would be that you might change the working copy of the remote even if you are offline.
